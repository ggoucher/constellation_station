# M9 - Constellation Station ðŸŒŒ

### A CSCI 3725 Project by Gerard Goucher

## Project Overview

My project encourages casual creativity in the users who decide to utilize it. They are creating constellation systems. This is done by the user clicking, and, upon release, a star being placed. When they click to place a new star, it is placed, and a constellation line is drawn between the two. Users are kept engaged by easy backtracking, easy clearing, and pretty colors with a relatively user friendly interface. Additionally, they are able to draw constellation lines between pre-existing stars (from their current star), which adds an additional creative component, making them proud of their piece of work that is more uniquely theirs. A line between preexisting stars is drawn if one clicks within 50 pixels of another star. By providing users a space where they can make something visually appealing and uniquely theirs, they are able to take pride in their original creation, and can easily screenshot and share their piece of work on social media should they choose to do so.

## Personal Meaning

When I first moved to Maine for college, I was absolutely fascinated by what I saw in the night sky. Coming from the Philadelphia area, I was so used to light pollution that I could never really take in the wonder of the nigth sky. Once I was in Maine, being able to look up and drink in all of the beauty of the sky above, I was totally enamored. Making this project is a lovely extension of that - time spent looking up in the sky and drawing connections between the stars above. Additionally, the visual appeal of the site and the coloring is quite calming - creating a serene effect during the stress of this crazy year.

## Personal Challenge

This project was pretty uniquely challenging, as I was making a product from start to finish. Using processing and thinking about visual development was challenging, too. I had to plan my code around how the user would interact with it, and also had to plan how I would present user creations using code. Furthermore, familiarizing myself with the processing langauge and mode of presentationw as a bit challenging as well, as I haven't used Java in a while. Additionally, resourcefully figuring out how to port my creation onto the internet was a bit of a challenge, too. Ultimately, thinking about user experience, seeing a project from beginning to end, and familiarizing myself with the processing language was difficult, but very rewarding to see a complete piece of work. Going forward, I think that creating more polished pieces of work would be vital - a complete project is great, but if it isn't rough around the edges, it's even better.

## Sources

Please note that the following sources were utilized to create our project:

[NYU CS](https://cs.nyu.edu/~kapp/cs101/processing_on_the_web/),
this source was utilized to figure out how to port my project through processing code to a JS file.

[Processing.js GitHub Repo](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js),
this source was utilized to grab the processing.js file to port my .pde creation to .js.

[Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/12112/how-do-you-clear-a-array),
this source was utilized to figure out how to clear entries in my Stars array.
